# Java Text Adventure Game

## Introduction

[Text Adventures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game), also known as 
[Interactive Fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Fiction) (IF), 
convey the game's story through passages of text, revealed to the player in 
response to typed instructions. Early text adventures, such as 
[Colossal Cave Adventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure),
used a simple verb-noun parser to interpret these instructions, allowing the player
to interact with objects at a basic level, for example by typing _get key_ or 
_open door_.

JAdventure is a very simple Java based implementation of a
Text Adventure.
    
**WARNING**

The current version has only one concrete Text Adventure game implemented. But it should be easy
to create additional games. See also [Improvement Ideas](./development/improvement-ideas.html).
